# Welcome to **Opening Advisor** for lichess.org!
## Opening Advisor is based on my previous project: **Chess MBTI**.
## It is designed to advice the best suiting openings based on your chess MBTI and in-game statistics.
## Main tools used in Opening Advisor are: Tensorflow (Keras), Scipy, Matplotlib, Pandas, etc.
## This repo will cover all theoretical and technical details of how I approached and designed the project.
## Hope every chess enthusiast will enjoy it!
